// 2D pattern matching program

To run the app you should open the terminal and type the command like this: 

 java -jar 2DPatternMatching.jar
 
 I've prepared executable jar file. It does not require any inputs or patterns,
 whatever it needs I put in the source code with sample data. For checking sample 
 matrices please watch "SamplePatternAndMatrices" class.
 
 About time and algorithm:
 
 At first I used brute force algorithm to find the pattern and it took me rather 
 one day to complete it. But its complexity was too high O(m*n*o*p)
 (if the first array is m*n, and the second is o*p). 
 
 Afterward I've made a decision to find a better way. And founding KMP string matching 
 algorithm with o(n). With this approach it requires additional 2D array to 1D array conversion, 
 so it takes a preprocessing phase to change these two arrays to 1d arrays with 
 O(m * n + o * p) complexity. And also I made a change in KMP algorithm to check 
 for not being any other form of pattern in matrices.
